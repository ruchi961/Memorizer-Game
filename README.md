## > Idea Behind the game :
1. The game is called Memorizer, a game to test individual's
capacity to remember.
2. The game sets a timer and allows user to memorize the
numbers available in the grid format.
3. Once the timer is finished, the user can enter the number
referring to the row and column of the same.
4. The whole purpose of this game to test userâ€™s capability to
remember things and recollect information.
5. lastly, statistics of wrong and correct answers is displayed


## > Rules (Algorithm):
1. Start Game
2. Time starts for 5 seconds (As long as the timer is on the
user cannot enter numbers)
3. Timer ends, all the numbers are replaced with * to hide
them.
4. Attempt timer starts for 60 seconds, now the user can
enter number by referring to its row and column.
5. User clicks on check and is notified if the current ddanswer
is right or wrong.
6. After 65 seconds that is (5+60) the timer to attempt ends
7. Use can now see the answer of total correct and
wrong/not attempted questions.
8. Game finished.
